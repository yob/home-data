* executing actions/automations that change the real world
  * splits on to cool when outside temp is hot and power is cheap?
  * heat hot water only when solar is generating or power is > 10c/kWh?
  * turn on ac/heaters when power price is negative and we can be paid to consume?
* proper state, not a sync.Map. Maybe redis? Maybe cockroachdb cloud so I can learn it?
  * or maybe just in memory is fine, but persist it to disk as a JSON file
* An option to set a TTL on state updates would be nice
  * setting the temp for a room is only valid for a short while. If the sensor goes offline for
    some reason, other actors in the system should eventually stop seeing the temperature in state so
    they don't assume a value that's incorrect
* expand use of shared entities
  * add entities.Switch, for powering daikin AC on/of, and kasa plugs on/off
  * add Read() methods to entities.{SensorBoolean, SensorGuage, SensorTime}, and use them in
    datadog adaptor, rule evaluation
* buy a WebRelay Quad (https://www.controlbyweb.com/webrelay-quad/) and control my hot water
  * or maybe something with a few inputs for things like water pulse meters

* integrate physical buttons to actions. Maybe via the hub, which can be programmed to send HTTP
  requests to this app
