* executing actions/automations that change the real world
  * splits on to cool when outside temp is hot and power is cheap?
  * heat hot water only when solar is generating or power is > 10c/kWh?
  * turn on ac/heaters when power price is negative and we can be paid to consume?
* proper state, not a sync.Map. Maybe redis? Maybe cockroachdb cloud so I can learn it?
* expand use of shared entities
  * add entities.Switch, for powering daikin AC on/of, and kasa plugs on/off
  * add Read() methods to entities.{SensorBoolean, SensorGuage, SensorTime}, and use them in
    datadog adaptor, rule evaluation
* buy a WebRelay Quad (https://www.controlbyweb.com/webrelay-quad/) and control my hot water
  * or maybe something with a few inputs for things like water pulse meters

* If the ruuvi gateway ever becomes available, consider switching to that
  * if it supports polling via a local API
  * might be a lot less moving parts compared to the bluewalker/jsontohttp shenanigans i have going on
* integrate physical buttons to actions. Maybe via the hub, which can be programmed to send HTTP
  requests to this app
