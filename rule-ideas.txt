## pre-warm kitchen on cold mornings

//every minute
//if current hour is 6 && 
//   last triggered > 12 hours ago && 
//   kitchen temp is <= 13 &&
//   kitchen split is off then
//      set last triggered to now()
//      turn on kitchen heater
//      bonus: turn on ceiling fan

## vent steam from the bathroom

//every minute
//if bathroom fan is off &&
//   last triggered on > 5 min ago && 
//   last triggered off > 5 min ago && 
//   bathroom humidity is > xx then
//     set last triggered to now()
//     turn on bathroom fan

## stop venting steam when not needed any more, retain building envelope

//every minute
//if bathroom fan is on &&
//   last triggered on > 5 min ago && 
//   last triggered off > 5 min ago && 
//   bathroom humidity is < xx then
//     set last triggered to now()
//     turn off bathroom fan

## Slowly ramp up self-consumption if we have spare solar generation

//every minute
//if last triggered up+down > 2 mins ago &&
//   hot water relay is off then
//     turn on hot water relay
//     set last triggered to now()
// elsif outside temp > 30 &&
//   room x temp is > 25 &&
//   room x AC is off then
//     turn on room x AC
//     set last triggered to now()
// elsif outside temp < 15 &&
//   room x temp is < 15 &&
//   room x heater is off then
//     turn on room x heater
//     set last triggered to now()


## Slowly ramp down self-consumption if we're cosuming more than we generate spare solar generation

//every minute
//if last triggered up+down > 2 mins ago &&
//   hot water relay is on then
//     turn off hot water relay

## Hot water base rule 

It might be desirable to keep hot water out of other rules. We want hot water
every day, not only when the sun shines or power is cheap.

//if excess solar generation is > 1000W &&
//   hot water relay is off
//     turn on hot water relay
//     set last triggered to now()

//if excess solar generation is <= 0W &&
//   hot water relay is on
//     turn off hot water relay
//     set last triggered to now()

// target_mins_per_day=480 
//if minutes on today < target_mins_per_day &&
//   (6pm - now) >= (target_mins_per_day - minutes on today) &&
//   hot water relay is off
//     turn on hot water relay
//     set last triggered to now()

// target_mins_per_day=480 
//if minutes on today >= target_mins_per_day &&
//   hot water relay is on &&
//   amber electric prices > 10c then
//     turn offf hot water relay
//     set last triggered to now()

## Hot water bonus heating when electricity is cheap 

//every minute
//if last triggered on+off > 2 mins ago &&
//   hot water relay is off &&
//     amber electric prices < 10c then
//     turn on hot water relay
//     set last triggered to now()

## Hot water bonus heating when electricity is expensive 

//every minute
//if last triggered on+off > 2 mins ago &&
//   hot water relay is on &&
//     amber electric prices > 40c then
//     turn off hot water relay
//     set last triggered to now()

## Recommendations

// every minute
// if inside humidity > X &&
//   outside humidity < Y &&
//   outside temp > something comfortbale (15?) &&
//   outside temp < too hot (30?)
//     toggle "recommend opening house" on

// every minute
// if inside humidity within ~10% of outside humidity &&
//   currently recommending to open house
//     toggle "recommend opening house" off
